### How Weather Changes with Lattitude and What That Means for Your Next Vacation

The point of this exercise is two-fold:  (1) to see how such things as temperature, wind speed, and humidity vary with latitude and (2) to use the weather results that derive from this analysis to select the ideal vacation spot.

This repo contains a folder (WeatherPy_&_VacationPy) with four files and a folder which contains the results generated by the first part of the exercise for use by the second part of the exercise.

In the WeatherPy_&_VacationPy folder is the code for the first part of the exercise (WeatherPy) along with a Word file of the same name which provides an explanation of the WeatherPy code.  Also in this folder is the code for the second part of the exercise (VacationPy) along with a Word file of the same name which provides as explanation of the VacationPy code.  Finally, this folder contains another folder (output_data) which contains a *.csv file with some of the results generated in the first part of the exercise (cities.csv) and four *.png files (Fig1, Fig2, Fig3, Fig4) which contain ploted results generated during the first part of the exercise.

The final result of all of the above is to identify several cities with ideal climate and hotels in which you could stay were you to visit those cities.
